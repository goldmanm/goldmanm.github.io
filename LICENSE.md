summary: I am flattered that you like my work

I have separated license restrictions to the MIT license for formatting (because I am fine sharing the website template with others) and Creative Commons for the images and posts made by me (because I don't want to be improperly quoted and would like compensation if any commercial gain comes from my writings). Feel free message me if you'd like things licensed differently. The details are below.
