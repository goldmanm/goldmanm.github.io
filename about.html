    <!-- <div class="solidline"></div> -->

    <p>I've always had a fascination with learning, doing, and experimenting, and my experience spans across research, design, and writing code. </p>

    <p>I have experience with <em>Adobe Creative Suite</em>, <em>Microsoft Office</em>, <em>Axure</em>, and other design and productivity tools. I prefer to prototype websites in HTML, JavaScript and SASS/CSS, and other experiences in Flash, but I'm familiar with anything from C to Processing. </p>

    <p>My eclectic background mirrors my eclectic upbringing. Though born in China, I moved to Stockholm at a young age.</p> <p>I am fluent in <em>English</em> and <em>Swedish</em>, and conversational in <em>Mandarin</em>.</p> <p>I hold <em>dual citizenship</em> with both the <em>United States</em> and <em>Sweden</em>, which means that I could easily work in and out of the U.S. and countries European Union without a work visa.</p>

    <p>On my off days, I enjoy swing dancing, rock climbing, playing indie games, and cooking and stuffing my face with some tasty food. </p>

    <span class="section-title-large topline">About this Site</span>
    <!-- <div class="solidline"></div> -->

    <p>This site's probably my umpteenth portfolio redesign, as I seem to want to create a new one every three months. This one will hopefully last longer, as it has a blog element, is written in SASS, is fairly robust, and is hosted for free at Github.</p>

    <p>Initially I crawled through many CMS and hosting systems, including WordPress, and didn't like any of them: WordPress was too cumbersome for my needs, and the other sites were too costly on a long-term basis. I landed on Github Pages out of chance, found out you could host and blog for free, and are given complete freedom in design, thanks to a static generator technology called Jekyll. </p>

    <p>At some point I'll create a post to show exactly how I created this site. For now, <a href="https://github.com/janzheng/janzheng.github.com">branch my repo</a> and shoot me an e-mail for questions if you have any questions. </p>
