Well, I'll be honest. I'm a terrible writer, and I'm terrible at updating content, mostly because I hate writing.

But, as an active practitioner in User Experience and web design, and an active maker of cool and experimental stuff, I kind of realized I need a tiny corner of the web to show off things to say, and share a little back with the community.

Thing is, the community is vibrant and full of smart people, many of whom share knowledge for free. Despite my not enjoying writing, as a professional, I need to have a public voice for my opinions tips, and give-back to the community.

That, and I'm actually fairly opinionated. I just don't like writing about it.

This site will double up as a sounding board for my professional voice, and as a portfolio site so I can continue to feed myself and stuff.

In this side of the web, I'll be focusing on User Experience & Interaction Design, Web Design, and Game Design. A few of my passions.

Why is this so drab and boring?! Well, I'm minimalist, and I want the content to shine. That, and I don't really want to spend more time illustrating stuff.
