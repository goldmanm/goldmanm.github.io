[Mint](https://www.mint.com/) is a service that gives people all their finances in one page, and has brought me convenience. Through the ~3 years of using their service I saw the increasing of advertisements and stagnation of new features. Some of its advertisements are terribly inaccurate. For example, I got a fee refund in my transactions section. Mint classified this as an 'fee', and posted an advertisement: "you just got a fee. you should apply for a fee-free [checking account](https://www.ted.com/watch/ted-institute/ted-ibm/marie-wallace-privacy-by-design)". Ironically, I already told Mint that I had the exact account they were advertising. These type of ads have happen quite often. I am not sure whether the programmers are incompetent or if they get more revenue for putting irrelevant ads.

Yesterday, they updated their terms of service and privacy policy, and didn't give any description about it. I normally don't read every privacy policy, but this site has my finantial information, so I took a look at it. I'll leave you with what I found the most striking (section 13: rules for posting):

	"By submitting content to us, you represent that you have all necessary rights and hereby grant us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, modify, display, and perform all or any portion of the content in connection with Services and our business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the site (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels."
	
This broad use licence, hidden within the 15,000 words of legalese, really did not make me feel comfortable giving Intuit my data. Thankfully, I found that I could delete my account and Intuit will remove some of my data within 48 hours. They claim all the data will be removed, though their statement "some information may be retained on a server or media, which is necessary to help ensure continued availability of our products and services" raises some concerns for me. For example, would keeping the data to sell to others (so they can stay in business) be considered necessary to ensure the availability of products? Honestly, I am not sure how far this statement can be taken. 

While I appreciate the convenience Mint has provided me, I don't feel they really have my best interests at heart. I'll happily go back to managing my own finances manually (which I've already started to revert to after I noticed some numerical errors in Mint's algorithms)
