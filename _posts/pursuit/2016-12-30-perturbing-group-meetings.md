During weekly catered research group meetings, we often get food, with disposable plates, silverware, cups, and other usual vectors for consumption. For over a year, I have brought the bowl from my desk that I use to heat up leftovers for lunch. This past summer, a post doc joined the lab that brought a tupperware to eat out of. Only a few meetings later, another post-doc, who had been in the group for 6 months already, started bringing tupperware. 

In August, I thought a bit about what causes people to bring (or not) a reusable vessel for food consumption. It does seem a little like you 'expect' food when you go out of your way to bring a container, which can seem a bit selfish (at least that is what I am afraid others think when I come ready to reduce landfill waste). Another barrier might just be forgetfulness. We are bombarded with things we 'should' do, and we can't simply do them all.

I half-joke that I volunteer at the food bank because my friends do (as opposed to helping people). More realistically, helping others, feeling part of a community, and having someone else deal with the logistics keep me going back to volunteer. Applying that logic, I wondered if a combination of lowering the barrier to bringing reusable dishes and a little more social pressure could entice a few more people a to bring reusable dishes. 

I set a plan into action: buy dishes and utensils for people who want them and then watch for atrophy or growth. I sent out an email allowing people to specify color/design/etc, and 8 responded. I bought items for them from [GoodWill](https://www.goodwillmass.org/) and waited to see what happened. Some people said they forgot respond to the email, so I brought a few more. Others were astonished that I went out of my way to buy them which might have guiled them into participating. From September to December, everyone to whom I gave dishes, except one, brought them very reliably (<10% forget rate). In addition, another student that didn't respond to the email started bringing her own dish. At the start of December, we had a new post-doc join the group. At the last meeting of the semester group meeting he also brought a dish in.

Watching the effect of this semester-long social perturbation fascinated me more than a RedSox home game. Their participation showed me that being helpful to others is much more contagious than just hoping your action will catch on. By lowering the barrier (and accidentally adding some guilt), Four times as many people used reusable dishes than before, 2 of which brought dishes from home. How much this actually assisted the environment is another question.

With some knowledge gained from my industrial ecology course this past semester, I can begin to assess the environmental impact. One big takeaway from the course was how much effort goes into each life cycle assessment. I honestly don't have time to do a full life cycle assessment on this, but I can begin to frame the question. For simplicity, we can place the environmental burden of producing the utensils on the primary consumer, and the disposal of the items on me. The critical factor is the impact of producing and incinerating the disposable plates, spoons, cups, etc. not used to the impact of sending the reusable items I purchased for incineration. We can adjust for the disposable items producing electricity during combustion, and other fancy tricks to nail down that accuracy. The major sensitive factor, which we experienced in our class's analysis project, is the number of avoided disposable items for each reusable plate. Due to this project's continued success, I'll have to wait till 2017 (and maybe beyond) to find out how many items each reusable plate will keep out of the landfill. 

Happy new year!
