Well, I'll be honest. I'm a terrible writer, and I'm terrible at updating content. Most of the time I feel like I don't have anything to talk about.

But, as an active practitioner in User Experience and web design, and an active maker of cool and experimental stuff, I kind of realized I need a tiny corner of the web to sound off new ideas, tips, and such, and share a little knowledge back to the community.

Thing is, the User Experience and web design community is vibrant and full of smart people, many of whom share knowledge for free. Despite not being a stellar writer, I feel like we're obliged as professionals to voice our own opinions, and to give a little feedback back to the community.

This site will look at User Experience, Game Design, and Interaction Design topics. And probably a few more other ones. 

Good stuff is coming. Promise!
