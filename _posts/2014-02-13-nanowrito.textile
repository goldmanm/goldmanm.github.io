h2. Writing is Hard.

p(post-first-sentence). That probably doesn't come as a surprise, considering my posts are dated a year apart from each other. Maybe writing is just hard for me. I tend to re-read my sentences, correct myself ad nauseam until my sentences seem right. Or I get distracted. And then I erase the entire paragraph because it doesn't fit. Most people call it Writer's Block: the scourge of a writer's productivity.

But I'm not so sure that it's a real medical affliction. It's more of a manifestation of doubts and anxieties in theirwork or abilities. It might be the sheer size of the challenge of writing itself that stops would-be writers in their tracks. Or our ability to constantly question our decisions. Or our technology-fueled ability to self-criticize and compare ourselves to the "successes of others":http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/the-real-reason-facebook-makes-us-unhappy.html.


h2. But Writing can be Wonderful.

p. Creative writing on its own, without any distractions or goals or objectives or spellchecking, can also be a beautiful thing. As a kid I used to write many short stories, if anything, as a way to let my mind loose. When you write creatively, you give yourself this sandbox of unlimited possibilities. You can completely let go; let inner child and sense of wonderment come alive. It doesn't have to make sense. In fact, no one should read it. When you write for yourself, it shouldn't make sense. These are your inner thoughts and your soul at work; your ego and your super-ego wrestling control, and letting loose on the keyboard. 

A pure, free-flowing writing state is a combination meditation and play; an exhilarating stream of subconsciousness, spilling dreams on paper. 

Unfortunately, most of us are conditioned to not let our subconscious wander too far. Our pursuits of perfection distract us from retreating into a meditative state. Accordingly,writing subconsciously is suggested to make us both "faster and more creative writers":http://www.creativitypost.com/create/writing_at_the_speed_of_the_unconscious.

h2. Novel Under Deadlines

National Writing Novel Month, or "NaNoWriMo":http://NaNoWriMo.com, is a program that is about using time as a constraint to enable creation. On the first day of November, roughly 340,000 people begin writing their novels from scratch. And by the last day, they must have written at least 50,000 words to be considered winners. This amounts to roughly 1,600 words a day. This isn't a large number for professional writers, but for those who have only fleetingly thought about writing, can be quite a daunting goal. There's the job, friends, and errands. Out of those 340,000 participants, only 40,000 actually finished. 

The point of NaNo is for beginners to just start writing. To stop thinking about editing, and to start putting thoughts down on paper. The goal is to complete a sloppy, though finished first draft. To not stop writing, even if the story stops in its tracks. NaNo's mission is to encourage people to spend the month of November to take that leap and focus on putting words down, with the support of a larger community.



h2. Feature Reduction

!/assets/posts/nanowrito/1.png!"
Technology has enabled us to do many, many things. In the world of writing, movable type and eventually typewriters allowed us to quickly create and reprint documents. Of course, as the computer came along, text-editors ushered in a new era of tech-fueled features, Like the Backspace, or the Undo. Or the ability to change, reflow, and move anything you've written to anywhere else.

All these technologies have been great at enabling us to do more and more things, but in that pursuit of more features, a certain purity has been lost. Similar to decision paralysis, having the super-heroic abilities to do _anything_ can be daunting. 

Recently, there's a trend that has been going for minimalism and reduction. "Flat UI":http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/03/flat-and-thin-are-in/ and Durr, the watch that "doesn't have a watchface":http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/30/5361210/skrekkogle-durr-the-watch-without-a-face, is a good example of this trend. 

Similarly, to enable speedy, undistracted, and subconscious writing, we must remove extraneous features and design for purpose.



h2. Zen Mode

"!/assets/posts/nanowrito/2.png!":http://nanowrito.org

I created NanoWrito during the first week of November 2013, after trying to find a better alternative than Word or Sublime. I needed something simple, not distracting, and could tell me the word count easily. Something more similar to a typewriter than a word processor. So I set out to create my own app. 

It's very minimalist, as it consists of a text-box and a word counter, that large 0 looking into your eyes. When users click enter, the text is moved to an uneditable field where users won't be able to go back and fix anything. Anything they write is immutable durig this session. An alternate Zen Mode darkens the screen and blurs out the previously written words, so users can't clearly read the content, but would know that their work is being updated. A Flash module assists in copying the work to somewhere safe, and the Close functionality is guarded from accidentally closing the app. 

For the month of November, the project was fairly successful. I only put up links on the NanoWrimo apps forum, and on the NaNoWriMo subreddit, and garnered a few thousand unique visitors, with a number of daily recurring visitors.

And where in the previous two years I barely finished using the entire month of November, this year I was also able to finish my novel in less than two weeks.
