bq. "The possibilities feel endless! Potential love connections everywhere!" - "HuffPo":http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/02/unwritten-rules-tinder_n_3689441.html

p(post-first-sentence). That's the sentiment most people share when they fire up the app.

Ever since my friend convinced me to get Tinder (ahum), I've had this thought: Tinder isn't just addictive because the media labels it as a "dirty hookup app where everyone gets laid":http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/10317832/Tinder-review-a-womans-perspective.html, but because it's a well-designed, instantly gratifying skinner box that promises the potential for hookup instead of food pellets. 

According to this "Telegraph article,":http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/10317832/Tinder-review-a-womans-perspective.html "The quick follow-through from swipe to sex is similarly instinctive for a generation with an appetite for immediacy." How many Tinder users actually end up hooking up, I don't know, but we can agree that Tinder provides something very salient and gratifying, regardless whether the sex happens or not.

The app is essentially a marriage of Hot or Not and World of Warcraft. It takes advantage our generation's craving for immediacy, gratification, and validation, while providing plenty of pictures of attractive young women. And instead of the fantasy of killing monsters, it runs off the allure of potentially getting some. 




h2. Press the lever

Remember from Psych 101 that behavior can be learned through rewards and punishment ("operant conditioning":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning), and how psychologists used the "Skinner Box":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinner_box to experiment with behavioral learning through different kinds of rewards and punishment. For example, a rat would press a lever, which would yield a food pellet. If the number of rewards were reduced for each lever press, the rats would persist in pushing the lever until they received a reward, leading to a high number of lever presses regardless. Thus, the behavior of the rat was shaped to press that lever.

Also recall that in operant conditioning, one of the most successful ways to shape a behavior (a 'response') is called a "variable ratio schedule":http://www.betabunny.com/behaviorism/VRS.htm of reinforcement. The way it works is that at first, a rat receives a steady number of rewards for their response. For example, one food pellet is given for every lever press. Once the rat has learned the response, the number of rewards is only given after a variable number of correct responses. This causes the rat to perform the response anyway, as it doesn't stop immediately after the rewards have stopped.

Similarly, if the rat keeps pressing the lever but the rewards have stopped, eventually the rat will reduce the number of times it will press the lever. This type of behavior is called extinction.

Examples of variable ratio schedules in the wild include slot machines, leveling up in certain video games like in EverQuest "(read: EverQuest: The Virutal Skinner Box)":http://www.nickyee.com/eqt/skinner.html or in Zynga's FarmVille. In these games, you receive either money or XP/coins/crafting for a variable (random) number of attempts. This causes people to feel that trying harder will get them a reward, and if they haven't received a reward yet, doing so a little bit longer will net them the reward. This causes people to pull the lever more for the reward.

This is the short take on why gambling and games could be so addictive.



h2. "This online dating app is really a judging app"

So what does all of this have to do with an online dating app?

Tinder turns online dating on its head by embracing several game mechanics and by deliberately removing features that are common among traditional dating apps. The app only presents users with one profile at a time, and does not allow for users to list or search for profiles. It forces users to rate a profile in order to receive a new one, and introduces a swipe feature that makes it incredibly easy for users to rate profiles. This creates an environment that is easily explorative and accessible. The user doesn't have many options. Either turn left, or turn right. See someone you don't like? Swipe left. See someone cute? Press the lever.

Tinder eschews the traditional aspect of carefully choosing and connecting with potential suitors and instead throws them in your face.




h2. Another kind of food pellet

bq. "That deeply personal, useful and instantly gratifying information makes Tinder an addictive experience, with each match fueling a kind of emotional high. Research has shown 'likes' on Facebook and retweets and Twitter can release a dopamine surge that lead to social media addiction. It suggests we're all but starving for likes. in our push to figure out which strangers, and how many, think we're hot."
- "Huffington Post":http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/tinder-dating-app_n_3044472.html#slide=1946649

Tinder's reward structure is fascinating. A reward comes in the form of not only browsing and judging others, but from the feedback: A user will know instantly if someone likes you back. And even if there is no match, there's a chance the user hasn't been viewed yet. Furthermore, any user that hasn't been matched can't be messaged. This not only speaks to social validation, but it also shields users from the potential shame of rejection and from unsolicited messages. While many dating sites might either yield a bevy of unreturned messages or a deluge unsolicited emails Tinder's design completely sidesteps these problems.

They key to Tinder's successful reward structure is its entirely positiive reinforcement scheme. 



h2. But is it actually _bad_ for society?

h2. Social

One would think that the ultimate reward of using Tinder is from a successful hookup, but I'm curious to see whether more people use Tinder for social validation than for actually hooking up.

- liking someone isn't an awkward compliment, or creepy compliment
- people look for validation; teens do too online (ars tech article) - amisex / amiugly - tinder provides the validation without the negative aspects
- 
- helps introverted / unsociable to voice ou
- The part where users may message each other is cream on the crop it rewards them with the possibility of contacting each other
- easy to like someone
- rewards judging someone by a potential match
- turn down creeps
- interesting to see how many users use it for just social validaiton; how many matches are made but no one talks; number of non-replies, how many people swipe 'yes' even to people they don't like (can be inferred from non-replies)
a match means:
- affirmation: someone likes you back

The app appears to be "shallow" by constraining the amount of information users can enter about themselves. It also 



But what is going on behind the scenes, in the app's algorithm?
Providing matches in a random variable ratio



"My sociopathic curiosity and appetite for constant validation are fuelled by Tinder's addictive swipe function. I start consuming hundreds of profiles on boring journeys or in queues for a slow barista. Oh, the immediate gratification of having eight suitors when I woke up this morning! Didn't reply to any, but it's nice to know they're out there. Tinder totally complements my lazy and attention-seeking personality. "
- attention-seeking persona
- instant gratification
- what's the gratification? Social acceptance, inclusion, social validation. 
- safe and protected. If you don't respond, or if you block, no one gets (really) hurt.

- The internet is cruel and creepy (for women), and this is a site about validation.
- Dating apps like these could potentially do to dating (and to people) what Netflix and iTunes, Spotify did to movies and song- made them insignificant, trivial, commoditized (more on that on another post)

The male and female difference
More older men, fewer older women. 

as long as people are careful, and treat is as what it is- a game


"“likes” on Facebook and retweets and Twitter can release a dopamine surge that, in some cases, lead to social media addiction. ":http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/27514afc-5444-11e2-9d25-00144feab49a.html

""It grants permission for those in our culture to rate others based on physical appearance, and furthermore, it teaches us how to slash an 'X' on those we find unattractive (too old, too short, too much facial hair)," lamented Carlina Duan, a contributor to the University of Michigan's Michigan Daily student newspaper, in a story about Tinder. “It teaches us that dating, then, is a process of physical attraction and only physical attraction."
>> don't we do this on a daily basis anyway? Society tells us this is wrong, but you and I both know this is what we do.

retort to physical attraction: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/29/okcupid-profile-picture-experiment_n_1638322.html
"Millward did find there were huge differences in the attention each profile received. He noticed the two women who were at the top of his attractiveness scale received 581 percent more messages than the other three women combined.

He also found that the most-frequently contacted woman, whom he and the judges had ranked second highest in attractiveness, had nearly 17 times more messages within a week than the most contacted man. The group of five females were also more-frequently contacted than the males, w"




So what are the results of this casually browsing through potential hookups? The commoditization of people, of course. It's shallow, and it's self-boosting. We don't have to work for 

But in the end, are people really only satisfied with physical relationships? Even if many people successfully hook up using Tinder, is it really going to transform people into the shallow commoditized pieces of meat that the media portrays us? Or will it just increase our hunger for more deeper, more fulfilling emotional relationships?

But in the end, have fun, don't be serious. Now if you'll excuse me, I have have more swiping to get back to.




p.s.

The entire database Tinder sits on is like a social rank. Because people vote each other up or down, this is essentially one big popularity contest, showing how people stack up against each other. Would be interesting if that data ever got out.
