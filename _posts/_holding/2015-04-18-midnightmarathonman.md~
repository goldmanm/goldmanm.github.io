Yesterday, I participated in the [Midnight Marathon](https://www.midnightmarathon.org/), where bicyclists ride the Boston marathon path the night before the runners race for the finish. Like many bike enthusiasts, I decided to bike to the start point, and then bike back to the finish, essentially finishing the marathon twice. Since my friends were only doing the ride back, I joined a few hundred people at the Boston Commons to head over together. I arrived at 9pm, about 20 minutes before our departure for the 50-60 mile (80-90 km) bike ride. 

I am not sure why I feel a little shaky when alone in large crowds of people who I haven't met. I think this is because I have only ended up meeting amazing people have having rewarding experiences from getting into new environments. Being 'alone' is definitely the wrong word to describe the situation, since I was actually in the presence of hundreds of potential friends. Regardless of rationality, I felt a little out of place with a sea of people in full biking gear chatting in small groups about what's going on in their lives. I look around to find someone to talk to. Through the blinking bike lights, I see a short guy in his mid-30s standing alone. He wore vans shoes, sweat pants, a sweat shirt, and had a pair of burnt-orange gloves on a pack behind his bike. He didn't seem occupied by talking with other people or by his cell-phone, so I thought I'd be less intrusive talking to him than to most other people. 

This man exemplified humility, trust, passion, and control over anxiety. I am ashamed that I remember about his name was that it started with 'Nee' and had two syllabes. We introduced ourselves, and he had a slight African accent. The first think he did was complement my decade old aluminum mountain bike, which I am quite proud of jerryrigging to be excellent for rainy commuting. In the dark light, his bike seemed like a standard road bike. Talk turned to our biking experience, and he casually sated that just last week he had biked from Washington DC to Boston, and in 2011 he went from Cali to Boston. I asked him more about it, learning that he did these adventures alone with no one and no plans as to where to sleep in the nights ahead. To find out about housing/camping areas, he would just ask around on his way and stated that people are really helpful. 

About this far into the conversation, the fog horns blasted and the 200+ bikers started pedalling along. After a few stoplights, I lost track of him in the mess of people, as he slowly manuvered through the crowd. Though the conversation was short, I found him remarkable. Though I'm probably not going to be biking accross the country any time soon, here are some attributes of him that I hope to emulate:

* He was confident enough in who he was to not need fancy equipment like biking jerseys or carbon fiber shoes. 
* He takes a week or more a year to go on long solo bike rides to keep this amazing hobby of his alive. 
* He calmly dealt with numerous undertainties on his bike trip, which he described were necessary for the freedom he desired. 
* He placed great trust in others during his travels.
