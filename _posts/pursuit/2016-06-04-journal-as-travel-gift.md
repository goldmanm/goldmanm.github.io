Have you ever been given something that a friend bought while
travelling? How much signifigance did it hold for you? Were you able to
use it or did it just sit on your shelf before you threw it away?
Unfortunately, most of these gifts held minimal meaning for me. I felt like I couldn't throw them away. I find messages and stories from friends much more meaningful.

When I studied abroad in 2013, I wrote a journal which I shared with
family/friends. Days & weeks after I sent
people my journal, family and friends shared that they enjoyed reading
it and it sparked fascinating conversations. Just last week in fact, a friend from my abroad university was reading my journal and asked when I'll come back to visit. For the physical gifts I brought back, I almost never saw or heard about them. Hearing about the journal over two years after giving it exemplifies the impact the journal had on him. 

Writing during the trip and editing after getting home takes a lot of
dedication. My trip seemed to go to the back of my head when I returned to see my friends, and my course load started picking up. In Singapore, some people shared confidential information,
so I made all the information anonymous. It took
four months after I returned to finalize the 150 page
story of my life in south-east asia. If I hadnâ€™t promised sending this to my friends and family (especially my grandmother), I probably woudn't have the motivation to finish.

In addition to being memorable, I found sharing my journal forced me to reflect on my experiences, scaled easier than traditional gifts, and reduced environmental footprint compared to gifts. When I was assigned to work in at Emirates Global Aluminum for two months in UAE, I decided to write another journal about my experiences and share it in lieu of material gifts. One of the major barriers for me was the effort in editing when back home. 
This is a combination of reviewing/editing the material and using a program to fit it into a proper format. From this experience, I gained a lot of appreciation for publishing editors. I found the ease of finalization is strongly dependent on the document processor. 

In 2013, I used MS Word
for the journal, which required lots of manipulation of figures. I
started the more recent journal in MS OneNote, since it seemed good for
note taking and automatically records dates of entries. I actually found
this worse than Word since it cannot crop/edit figures and has very
limited flexibility in PDF conversion and cross-references. I switched the entire document to Word and am implementing some visual basic for
applications (VBA) code for automating image manipulation. I will link to the code here when I have accomplished this. If you have used a platform that you found helpful for final editing, shoot me an
[email](mailto:markgoldman@mit.edu) and I can add it to this post (with credit). 

If you are travelling and want to return with a gift that provides deep meaning to your family and friends, I'd encourage you to make a shareable journal about your adventures. Here are some additional notes you might want to consider:

* get permission and protect the privacy of your friends you meet abroad.
* get your friends and family at home to nag you to finish when you get back.
* consider the end use you'd like for the journal. It might be different than a diary. 
* enjoy reflecting on your experiences during and after your trip.
