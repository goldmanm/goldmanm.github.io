p(post-first-sentence). So... I got totally excited when the Xbox One came out. You could turn it on and off just using your voice. Like magic!
But soon I realized that nope, it's nothing like magic. It's not like your personal butler. It's not even as smart as "Samantha!":http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/her/ And sometimes it doesn't work at all, and soon you'll find yourself yelling at your computer:

So here's a quick cheat sheet so you know at least you'll know the Xbox will listen to you. 

Soon after I started working on this cheat sheet (before the Xbox came out), Microsoft released their "official voice guide":http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/4/4/c/44c89c7f273167b4/Xbox_One_Kinect_Voice_Gesture.pdf?c_id=6458139&expiration=1391904000&hwt=8d03bf44dd44ad73fcbd5f4e858f9a92 and I've integrated some of their commands into my list. My list omits some of the more common commands for increased readability. The purpose and design goal of the sheet was to immediately let the reader find the command they needed, which not always apparent.
