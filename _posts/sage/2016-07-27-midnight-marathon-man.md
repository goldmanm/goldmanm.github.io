This past spring, I participated in the [Midnight Marathon](https://www.midnightmarathon.org/), where bicyclists ride the Boston marathon path the night before the runners race for the finish. Like many bike enthusiasts, I decided to bike to the start point, and then bike back to the finish, essentially finishing the marathon twice. Since my friends were only doing the ride back, I joined a few hundred people at the Boston Commons to head over together. I arrived at 9pm, about 20 minutes before our departure, for the 50-60 mile (80-90 km) bike ride. 

I am not sure why I, and many others, feel a little shaky when alone in large crowds of people who I haven't met. This urge is even more alarming since new, lonely environments have only ended up helping me meet amazing people and have rewarding experiences. Being 'alone' is definitely the wrong term to describe the situation; I was actually in the presence of hundreds of potential friends. Regardless of my irrationality, I felt a little out of place with a sea of people suited in full biking gear chatting in small groups about what's going on in their lives.

After about five minutes of nervous people-watching, I look around to find someone to talk to. Through the blinking bike lights, I see a short guy in his mid-30s standing alone. He wore vans shoes, sweat pants, a sweat shirt, and had a pair of burnt-orange gloves on a pack behind his bike. He didn't seem occupied by talking with other people or by using his cell-phone, so I thought I'd be less intrusive talking to him than the more intimidating 'groups' of people. Ironically being alone can be quite inviting. 

> A helmet, gloves, and bike lights surpassed sufficiency for him.

This man exemplified humility, trust, passion, and a control over anxiety. I am ashamed that all I can remember about his name was that it started with 'Nee' and had two syllables. We introduced ourselves, and he had a slight African accent. The first thing he did was complement my decade old aluminum mountain bike, which I am quite proud of jerry rigging to be excellent for rainy commuting. In the dark light, his bike seemed like a standard road bike without anything fancy. Talk turned to our biking experience, and he casually sated that just last week he had biked from Washington DC to Boston, and in 2011 he went from California to Boston. I asked him more about it, learning that he did these adventures alone with no plans as to where to sleep in the nights ahead. To find out about housing/camping areas, he would just ask around on his way and stated that people are really helpful. 

> He placed complete trust in others during his travels.

About this far into the conversation, the fog horns blasted and the 200+ bikers started pedaling along. After a few stoplights, I lost track of him in the mess of people, as he slithered through the hoards. Eventually, his silhouette blended into the night and I haven't seen him since. Though our conversation was short, I found him remarkable. I'm probably not going to be biking across the country any time soon, but here are some attributes of him that I aspire to emulate:

* He was confident enough in who he was to not need fancy equipment like biking jerseys or carbon fiber shoes. A helmet, gloves, and bike lights surpassed sufficiency for him.
* He takes a week or more a year to go on long solo bike rides to keep this amazing hobby of his alive. 
* He calmly dealt with numerous uncertainties on his bike trip. He stated these were necessary for the freedom he desired. 
* He placed complete trust in others during his travels.
