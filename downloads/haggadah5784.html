<h1>Haggadah 5784</h1>
<h2>Lighting the Candles</h2>
<p>The seder officially begins with a physical act: lighting the candles.  In Jewish tradition, lighting candles and saying a blessing over them marks a time of transition, from the day that is ending to the one that is beginning, from ordinary time to sacred time.  Lighting the candles during Passover reminds us of the importance of keeping the fragile flame of freedom alive in the world.</p>

<p><strong>ברוך אתה יי אלהנו מלך העולם, אשר כדשנו במצותיו, וצונו להדליק נר של יום תוב</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu melech ha'olam asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav, v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner shel Yom Tov.</em></p>
<p>Blessed are You, Adonai our God, Ruler of the Universe, who has sanctified us with laws and commanded us to light the festival lights.</p>

<p>As we light the festival candles, we acknowledge that as they brighten our Passover table, good thoughts, good words, and good deeds brighten our days.</p>
<h2>What's on the Table</h2>
<p><strong>The Seder Plate</strong></p>
<p>We place a Seder Plate at our table as a reminder to discuss certain aspects of the Passover story. Each item has its own significance.</p>
<p><em>Maror</em> – The bitter herb. This symbolizes the harshness of lives of the Jews in Egypt.</p>
<p><em>Charoset</em> – A delicious mix of sweet wine, apples, cinnamon and nuts that resembles the mortar used as bricks of the many buildings the Jewish slaves built in Egypt</p>
<p><em>Karpas</em> – A green vegetable, usually parsley, is a reminder of the green sprouting up all around us during spring and is used to dip into the saltwater</p>
<p><em>Zeroah </em>  – A beet symbolizes the blood of sacrifice made at the great temple on Passover (The Paschal Lamb)</p>
<p><em>Beitzah</em> – The egg symbolizes the second passover offering at the temple. Eggs, which are often offered to a mourner after a funeral, represents the cycle of life.</p>
<p><em>Orange</em> - The orange on the seder plate has come to symbolize full inclusion in modern day Judaism: for women, for people with disabilities, for people of different backgrounds, and for the LGBTQ Community.</p>
<p><strong>Matzah</strong></p>
<p>Matzah is the unleavened bread we eat to remember that when the jews fled Egypt, they didn’t even have time to let the dough rise on their bread. We commemorate this by removing all bread and bread products from our home during Passover.</p>
<p><strong>Elijah’s Cup</strong></p>
<p>The fifth ceremonial cup of wine poured during the Seder. It is left untouched in honor of Elijah, who, according to tradition, will arrive one day as an unknown guest to herald the advent of the Messiah. During the Seder dinner, biblical verses are read while the door is briefly opened to welcome Elijah. In this way the Seder dinner not only commemorates the historical redemption from Egyptian bondage of the Jewish people but also calls to mind their future redemption when Elijah and the Messiah will appear.</p>

<h2>Pesach is a time of inclusion</h2>
<p>On seder night, there are two moments where we metaphorically open our doors and invite others in. One is at the opening of the Magid portion of the seder, when we say, “All who are hungry come and eat.” There is a beautiful message here: we were once slaves; poor and hungry, and we remember our redemption by sharing what we have with others.</p>
<p>The other, comes towards the end of the seder, when we have the custom of pouring a fifth cup of wine, which we claim is for Elijah the Prophet. This is a statement of faith, a statement that says that although we are a free people, our redemption is not yet complete, and we believe that it will come.</p>
<p>From the most downtrodden to the most celebrated, the message is clear: everyone is welcome and everyone is necessary. Why is it that we go out of our way to include all at our seder table? Perhaps it is because when we make room for others, we have the opportunity to make room for ourselves as well. In fact, the Mishnah (Pesahim 10:5) teaches us that in every generation a person is obligated to see themselves as if they left Egypt.</p>
<p>The seder presents us with the obligation of identifying with the generation that left Egypt and internalizing that experience. And through that internalization, we come to feel the redemption as if it was our own as well. Further, the reliving of the story of the Exodus affords us the opportunity see one’s true self. It is only when we are able to see ourselves clearly, that we are able to be redeemed. But perhaps the only way we are able to see ourselves, is when we are truly able to see those around us. </p>
<h2>The 15 parts of a Passover Seder</h2>
<p>Seder means order. There are 15 parts that tradition dictates for our celebration.  They are:</p>
<p>1. KADESH - a blessing over wine</p>
<p>2. URCHATZ - ritual washing of hands without the usual blessing</p>
<p>3. KARPAS - eating some leafy greens or green vegetables</p>
<p>4. YACHATZ - raising up and breaking the middle Matzah</p>
<p>5. MAGGID - the telling of the Exodus story</p>
<p>6. RACHTZH - ritual washing of hands before eating</p>
<p>7. MOTZI – the blessing over bread and the meal</p>
<p>8. MATZAH – the blessing over the Matzah, emphasizing the special nature of eating Matzah</p>
<p>9. MARROR – eating bitter herbs</p>
<p>10. KORECH – eating a sandwich of Matzah and bitter herbs and the charoset</p>
<p>11. SHULCHAN ORECH – the festive meal</p>
<p>12. TZAFUN – eating the <em>Afikomen</em> (more on that later)</p>
<p>13. BARECH – grace after meals</p>
<p>14. HALLEL – singing psalms of praise</p>
<p>15. NIRTZAH – conclusion</p>

<h1>Kadesh</h1>
<h2>Sanctifying time</h2>

<p><em>[Fill everyone's cup]</p></em>

<p>The seder opens with kiddush (the sanctification over wine). This is certainly unremarkable after all, kiddush is the opening act of every shabbat and holiday meal. But kiddush – a ritual sanctification of time – has an intimate and unique connection to Pesach’s central theme: freedom. How so?</p>
<p>As Israel was about to be released from slavery, God instituted a new calendar: “This month will (mark for you the beginning of months; the first of the months of the year for you.” (Exodus 12:2) Why is this the first mitzva (commandment) communicated to a free nation?</p>
<p>A slave’s time is not his own. He is at the beck and call of his master. Even when the slave has a pressing personal engagement, his taskmaster’s needs will take priority. In contrast, freedom is the control of our time. We determine what we do when we wake up in the morning; we prioritize our day. This is true for an individual, but also for a nation. God commands Israel to create a Jewish calendar because, as an independent nation, Israel should not march any more to an Egyptian rhythm, celebrating Egyptian months and holidays. Instead Israel must forge a Jewish calendar, with unique days of rest, celebration and memory. Controlling and crafting our time is the critical first act of freedom.</p>
<p>Kiddush says this out loud. We sanctify the day and define its meaning! We proclaim this day as significant, holy and meaningful. We fashion time, claim ownership of it, and fashion it as a potent contact point with God, peoplehood, and tradition. This is a quintessential act of Jewish freedom.</p>
<p>Today, we often feel short of time; that time controls us. Kadesh reminds us that true freedom and self-respect is to master and control time for ourselves, to shape our life in accordance with our values.</p>

<h2>Kadesh</h2>



<p>All Jewish celebrations, from holidays to weddings, include wine as a symbol of our joy – not to mention a practical way to increase that joy. The seder starts with wine and then gives us three more opportunities to refill our cup and drink.</p>
<p><strong>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.</em></p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruit of the vine.</p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who chose us from all peoples and languages, and sanctified us with commandments, and lovingly gave to us special times for happiness, holidays and this time of celebrating the Holiday of Matzah, the time of liberation, reading our sacred stories, and remembering the Exodus from Egypt. For you chose us and sanctified us among all peoples. And you have given us joyful holidays. We praise God, who sanctifies the people of Israel and the holidays.</p>
<p><strong>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם</strong><br />
<strong> שֶׁהֶחֱיָנוּ וְקִיְּמָנוּ וְהִגִּיעָנוּ לַזְּמַן הַזֶּה</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam,</em><br />
<em>she-hechiyanu v’key’manu v’higiyanu lazman hazeh.</em></p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything,<br />
who has kept us alive, raised us up, and brought us to this happy moment.</p>
<p><em>[Drink the first glass of wine]</em></p>

<h1>Urchatz</h1>
<h2>Washing hands</h2>
<p>Water is refreshing, cleansing, and clear, so it’s easy to understand why so many cultures and religions use water for symbolic purification. We will wash our hands twice during our seder: now, with no blessing, to get us ready for the rituals to come; and then again later, we’ll wash again with a blessing, preparing us for the meal, which Judaism thinks of as a ritual in itself. </p>

<p>Too often during our daily lives we don’t stop and take the moment to prepare for whatever it is we’re about to do.</p>
<p>Let's pause to consider what we hope to get out of our evening together tonight. Go around the table and share one hope or expectation you have for tonight's seder.</p>
<h1>Karpas</h1>
<h2>Spring herbs</h2>
<p>Passover, like many of our holidays, combines the celebration of an event from our Jewish memory with a recognition of the cycles of nature. As we remember the liberation from Egypt, we also recognize the stirrings of spring and rebirth happening in the world around us. The symbols on our table bring together elements of both kinds of celebration.</p>
<p>We now take a vegetable, representing our joy at the dawning of spring after our long, cold winter. We now dip it into salt water, a symbol of the tears our ancestors shed as slaves. Before we eat it, we recite a short blessing:</p>
<p><strong>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree ha-adama.</em></p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruits of the earth.</p>
<p>We look forward to spring and the reawakening of flowers and greenery. They haven’t been lost, just buried in the cold, getting ready to reappear when we most need them.</p>

<h1>Yachatz</h1>
<h2>Breaking the Middle Matzah</h2>
<p><em>[Open the door]</em></p>
<p><em>[Hold up the three pieces of matzah on the table]</em></p>

<p>This is the bread of poverty which our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt. All who are hungry, come and eat; all who are needy, come and celebrate Passover with us. This year we are slaves; next year we will be free.</p>

<p><em>[Put down the pieces of matzah, pull out the middle matzah, and break it in half]</em></p>

<p>We now break the middle matzah into two pieces. Then we wrap up the larger of the pieces. This piece is called the afikomen, literally “dessert” in Greek. After dinner, we will get to enjoy this along with some delectable desserts.</p>
<p>We eat matzah in memory of the quick flight of our ancestors from Egypt. As slaves, they had faced many false starts before finally being let go. So when the word of their freedom came, they took whatever dough they had and ran with it before it had the chance to rise, leaving it looking something like matzah.</p>

<p>These days, matzah is a special food and we look forward to eating it on Passover. Imagine eating only matzah, or, like many now, not even having matzah to eat.</p>

<p><em>[Close the door]</em></p>

<h1>Maggid</h1>
<h2>The Four Questions</h2>
<p>The formal telling of the story of Passover is framed as a discussion with lots of questions and answers. The tradition that the youngest person asks the questions reflects the centrality of involving everyone in the seder. The rabbis who created the set format for the seder gave us the Four Questions to help break the ice in case no one had their own questions.</p>
<p><strong>מַה נִּשְׁתַּנָּה הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה מִכָּל הַלֵּילות</strong></p>
<p><em>Ma nishtana halaila hazeh mikol haleilot?</em></p>
<p>Why is this night different from all other nights?</p>
<p><strong>שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָֽנוּ אוֹכלין חָמֵץ וּמַצָּה  הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלּוֹ מצה  </strong></p>
<p><em>Shebichol haleilot anu ochlin chameitz u-matzah. Halaila hazeh kulo matzah.</em></p>
<p>On all other nights we eat both leavened bread and matzah.<br />
Tonight we only eat matzah.</p>
<p><strong>שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָֽנוּ אוֹכְלִין שְׁאָר יְרָקוֹת הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה מָרוֹר</strong></p>
<p><em>Shebichol haleilot anu ochlin shi’ar yirakot haleila hazeh maror.</em></p>
<p>On all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables,<br />
but tonight we eat bitter herbs.</p>
<p><strong>שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אֵין אָֽנוּ מַטְבִּילִין אֲפִילוּ פַּֽעַם אחָת  הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה שְׁתֵּי פְעמים</strong></p>
<p><em>Shebichol haleilot ain anu matbilin afilu pa-am echat. Halaila hazeh shtei fi-amim.</em></p>
<p>On all other nights we aren’t expected to dip our vegetables one time.<br />
Tonight we do it twice.</p>
<p><strong>שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָֽנוּ אוֹכְלִין בֵּין יוֹשְׁבִין וּבֵין מְסֻבִּין.  :הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלָּֽנוּ מְסֻבין</strong></p>
<p><em>Shebichol haleilot anu ochlin bein yoshvin uvein m’subin. Halaila hazeh kulanu m’subin.</em></p>
<p>On all other nights we eat either sitting normally or reclining.<br />
Tonight we recline.</p>
<h2>The Four Children - AJWS</h2>
<p>At Passover each year, we read the story of our ancestors’ pursuit of liberation from oppression. When confronting this history, how do we answer our children when they ask us how to pursue justice in our time?</p>
<p>WHAT DOES THE ACTIVIST CHILD ASK?</p>
<p>“The Torah tells me, ‘Justice, justice you shall pursue,’ but how can I pursue justice?”</p><p><em>Empower him always to seek pathways to advocate for the vulnerable. As Proverbs teaches, “Speak up for the mute, for the rights of the unfortunate. Speak up, judge righteously, champion the poor and the needy.”</em></p>
<p>WHAT DOES THE SKEPTICAL CHILD ASK?</p>
<p>“How can I solve problems of such enormity?” </p><p><em>Encourage her by explaining that she need not solve the problems, she must only do what she is capable of doing. As we read in Pirke Avot, “It is not your responsibility to complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from it.”</em></p>
<p>WHAT DOES THE INDIFFERENT CHILD SAY?</p>
<p>“It’s not my responsibility.” </p><p><em>Persuade him that responsibility cannot be shirked. As Abraham Joshua Heschel writes, “The opposite of good is not evil, the opposite of good is indifference. In a free society where terrible wrongs exist, some are guilty, but all are responsible.”</em></p>
<p>AND THE UNINFORMED CHILD WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ASK...</p>
<p><em>Prompt her to see herself as an inheritor of our people’s legacy.  As it says in Deuteronomy, “You must befriend the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.” At this season of liberation, join us in working for the liberation of all people. Let us respond to our children’s questions with action and justice. </em></p>
<h2>The Four Adults</h2>
<p>Now let's turn the four children upside down to remind us that as adults we have a lot to learn from youth. Young people have been, and are, at the forefront of most of the social justice movements on this planet.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong>The Angry Adult</strong> – Violent and oppressive things are happening to me, the people I love and people I don’t even know. Why can’t we make the people in power hurt the way we are all hurting? Hatred and violence can never overcome hatred and violence. Only love and compassion can transform our world.   </p>
<p><em>Cambodian Buddhist monk Maha Ghosananda, whose family was killed by the Khmer Rouge, has written:</em> It is a law of the universe that retaliation, hatred, and revenge only continue the cycle and never stop it. Reconciliation does not mean that we surrender rights and conditions, but means rather that we use love in all our negotiations. It means that we see ourselves in the opponent -- for what is the opponent but a being in ignorance, and we ourselves are also ignorant of many things. Therefore, only loving kindness and right-mindfulness can free us.</p>
<p><strong>The Ashamed Adult </strong>– I’m so ashamed of what my people are doing that I have no way of dealing with it?!? We must acknowledge our feelings of guilt, shame and disappointment, while ultimately using the fire of injustice to fuel us in working for change. We must also remember the amazing people in all cultures, who are working to dismantle oppression together everyday.   </p>
<p><em>Marianne Williamson said:</em> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate; our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us, it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.</p>

<p><strong>The Fearful Adult</strong> – Why should I care about ‘those people’ when they don’t care about me? If I share what I have, there won’t be enough and I will end up suffering. We must challenge the sense of scarcity that we have learned from capitalism and our histories of oppression. If we change the way food, housing, education, and resources are distributed, we could all have enough.</p>
<p><em>Martin Luther King said:</em> It really boils down to this: that all life is interrelated. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied into a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. We are made to live together because of the interrelated structure of reality.</p>
<p><strong>The Compassionate Adult</strong> – How can I struggle for justice with an open heart? How can we live in a way that builds the world we want to live in, without losing hope? This is the question that we answer with our lives.</p>
<p><em>Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote:</em> Just to be is a blessing. Just to live is holy. And yet being alive is no answer to the problems of living. To be or not to be is not the question. The vital question is: how to be and how not to be…to pray is to recollect passionately the perpetual urgency of this vital question.</p>
<p><em>Anne Frank wrote:</em> It’s really a wonder that I haven’t dropped all of my ideals, because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart. I simply can’t build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery, and death. I see the world gradually being turned into a wilderness, I hear the ever approaching thunder, which will destroy us too; I can feel the sufferings of millions and yet, if I look up into the heavens, I think that it will all come right, that this cruelty too will end and that peace and tranquility will return again. In the meantime, I must uphold my ideals, for perhaps the time will come when I shall be able to carry them out.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p>Each of us bears in our own belly the angry one, the ashamed one, the frightened one, and the compassionate one. </p>

<h2>Telling our Story</h2>
<p>Our story starts in ancient times, with Abraham, the first person to have the idea that maybe all those little statues his contemporaries worshiped as gods were just statues. The idea of one God, invisible and all-powerful, inspired him to leave his family and begin a new people in Canaan, the land that would one day bear his grandson Jacob’s adopted name, Israel.</p>
<p>God had made a promise to Abraham that his family would become a great nation, but this promise came with a frightening vision of the troubles along the way: “Your descendants will dwell for a time in a land that is not their own, and they will be enslaved and afflicted for four hundred years; however, I will punish the nation that enslaved them, and afterwards they shall leave with great wealth."</p>
<p><em>[Raise the glass of wine]</em></p>
<p><strong>וְהִיא שֶׁעָמְדָה לַאֲבוֹתֵֽינוּ וְלָֽנוּ</strong></p>
<p>V’hi she-amda l’avoteinu v’lanu.</p>
<p>This promise has sustained our ancestors and us.</p>
<p>For not only one enemy has risen against us to annihilate us, but in every generation there are those who rise against us. But God saves us from those who seek to harm us.</p>
<p><em>[Put the glass of wine down]</em></p>
<p>In the years our ancestors lived in Egypt, our numbers grew, and soon the family of Jacob became the People of Israel. Pharaoh and the leaders of Egypt grew alarmed by this great nation growing within their borders, so they enslaved us. We were forced to perform hard labor, perhaps even building pyramids. The Egyptians feared that even as slaves, the Israelites might grow strong and rebel. So Pharaoh decreed that Israelite baby boys should be drowned, to prevent the Israelites from overthrowing those who had enslaved them.</p>
<p>But God heard the cries of the Israelites. And God brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and outstretched arm, with great awe, miraculous signs and wonders. God brought us out not by angel or messenger, but through God’s own intervention. </p>
<h2>The Story of Exodus</h2>
<p>During the time when Pharaoh issued his decree to kill Israelite males, Moses, who later was to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt to freedom, was an infant. His concerned mother, Jochebed placed him in a basket of reeds in the Nile River while Moses’ sister Miriam watched from a distance to see who would come to find him. The basket was found by the Pharaoh’s daughter, who decided to raise the infant as her own son and named him Moses. She unknowingly hired Jochebed as a nurse to care for him, and Jochebed secretly taught Moses his Israelite heritage. At age 40, on a visit to see his fellow Israelites, Moses saw an Egyptian taskmaster beating an Israelite slave and in his rage, killed the Egyptian. Fearing for his life, Moses fled Egypt. He fled across the desert, for the roads were watched by Egyptian soldiers, and took refuge in Midian, an area in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia along the eastern shores of the Red Sea.</p>
<p>While in Midian, Moses met a Midianite priest named Jethro and became a shepherd for the next 40 years, eventually marrying one of Jethro’s daughters, Zipporah. Then, when Moses was about 80 years of age, God spoke to him from a burning bush and said that he and his brother Aaron were selected by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt to freedom. At first, Moses hesitated to take on such a huge task, but eventually Moses and his brother Aaron set about returning to Egypt, commencing what was to be the spectacular and dramatic events that are told in the story of Passover.</p>
<p>Under the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III in Egypt in 1476 BCE, the Israelite leader Moses – guided by God – led his people out of Egypt after a series of 10 plagues that were created by God and initiated by Moses. Prior to most of the plagues, Moses had warned the Pharaoh about each plague and that it would devastate his people, if he refused to let the Israelites go. After the first two plagues, the Pharaoh refused to let them go because his court magicians were able to re-create the same miracles, and so the Pharaoh thought: “This proves that the Israelite God is not stronger than I.” But when the third plague occurred, the Pharaoh’s magicians were not able to duplicate this miracle; however, that still did not change the Pharaoh’s mind about letting the Israelites leave Egypt. After each subsequent plague, the Pharaoh agreed to let the Israelites go, but the Pharaoh soon changed his mind and continued to hold the Israelites as slaves. Finally, after the 10th plague, the Pharaoh let the Israelites go for good.</p>
<p>When the Pharaoh finally agreed to free the Israelite slaves, they left their homes so quickly that there wasn’t even time to bake their breads. So they packed the raw dough to take with them on their journey. As they fled through the desert they would quickly bake the dough in the hot sun into hard crackers called matzah. Today to commemorate this event, Jews eat matzah in place of bread during Passover.</p>
<p>Though the Israelites were now free, their liberation was incomplete. The Pharaoh’s army chased them through the desert towards the Red Sea. When the Israelites reached the sea they were trapped, since the sea blocked their escape. When the Israelites saw the Egyptian army fast approaching toward them, they called out in despair to Moses. Fortunately, God intervened and commanded Moses to strike his staff on the waters of the Red Sea, creating a rift of land between the waves, enabling the Israelites to cross through the Red Sea to safety on the other side. Once the Israelites were safely across, God then commanded Moses to strike the waters of the Red Sea with his staff again, just as the Egyptian army followed them through the parted Red Sea. The waters came together again, drowning the entire Egyptian army.</p>


<h2>The Ten Plagues</h2>

<p><em>[Fill everyone's cup]</p></em>
<p>As we rejoice at our deliverance from slavery, we acknowledge that our freedom was hard-earned. We regret that our freedom came at the cost of the Egyptians’ suffering, for we are all human beings made in the image of God. We pour out a drop of wine for each of the plagues as we recite them.</p>
<p><em>[Dip a finger or a spoon into your wine glass for a drop for each plague.]</em></p>
<p>These are the ten plagues which God brought down on the Egyptians:</p>
<p>Blood | dam | <strong>דָּם</strong></p>
<p>Frogs | tzfardeiya |  <strong>צְפַרְדֵּֽעַ</strong></p>
<p>Lice | kinim | <strong>כִּנִּים</strong></p>
<p>Beasts | arov | <strong>עָרוֹב</strong></p>
<p>Cattle disease | dever | <strong>דֶּֽבֶר</strong></p>
<p>Boils | sh’chin | <strong>שְׁחִין</strong></p>
<p>Hail | barad | <strong>בָּרָד</strong></p>
<p>Locusts | arbeh |<strong> אַרְבֶּה</strong></p>
<p>Darkness | choshech | <strong>חֹֽשֶׁךְ</strong></p>
<p>Death of the Firstborn | makat b’chorot | <strong>מַכַּת בְּכוֹרוֹת</strong></p>
<p>The Pharoh needed ten plagues because after each one he was able to come up with excuses and explanations rather than change his behavior. Could we be making the same mistakes? What are some plagues in our life?</p>
<p><em>[Share ideas of modern plagues]</p></em>
<h2>Mitzrayim - the Narrow Place</h2>
<p>The Hebrew word for Egypt is translated as “narrow place.” Slavery in Egypt confined us to a narrow place, with constrictions on our physical, emotional, and spiritual lives. The Exodus is the story of liberation from the things that hold us back.</p>
<p>Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlov (1772-1822) said, “The Exodus from Egypt occurs in every human being, in every era, in every year, and in every day.” What an amazing opportunity we have every day – to liberate ourselves from what holds us back. Each choice we make, we face is an opportunity for liberation. This raises the question: how do we liberate those who are not free to choose?</p>

<p>The following song is based on the writings of this rabbi:</p>
<p><strong>​כָּל הַעוֺלַם כּולוֺ</strong></p>
<p><strong>גֶׁשֶׁר צַר מְאוֺד</strong></p>
<p><strong>וְהַעִיקַר לֺא לְפַחֵּד כְלַל</strong> </p>
<p>Kol Ha'olam kulo </p>
<p>Gesher Tsar me'od (3x) </p>
<p>Kol Ha'olam kulo </p>
<p>Gesher Tsar me'od (2x) </p>
<p>Veha'ikar - veha'ikar </p>
<p>Lo lefached - lo lefached klal. </p>
<p>Veha'ikar - veha'ikar lo lefached klal. </p>
<p>The wh​ole entire world </p>
<p>is a very narrow bridge (3x)</p>
<p>The whole entire world </p>
<p>is a very narrow bridge (2x)</p>
<p>But the main thing to recall</p>
<p>is to have no fear, have no fear at all</p>
<p>But the main thing to recall is to have no fear at all.</p>

<h2>Dayenu </h2>
<p>We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and God took us from there with a strong hand and outstretched arm. Had God not brought our ancestors out of Egypt, then even today we and our children and our grandchildren would still be slaves. Even if we were all wise, knowledgeable scholars and Torah experts, we would still be obligated to tell the story of the exodus from Egypt.</p>
<p>Dayenu is a song celebrating all that we are grateful that God did for us.</p>
<p>אִלוּ הוֹצִיאָנוּ מִמִצְרַים, דַּיֵינוּ</p>
<p>אִלוּ קָרַע לָנוּ אֶת הַיָּם, דַּיֵינוּ</p>
<p>אִלוּ הֶאֱכִילָנוּ אֶת הַמָּן, דַּיֵינוּ</p>

<p>אִלוּ קֵרְבָנוּ לִפְנֵי הַר סִינַי, דַּיֵינוּ</p>
<p>אִלוּ נַָתַן לָנוּ אֶת הַתּוֹרָה, דַּיֵינוּ</p>
<p> אִלוּ הִכְנִיסָנוּ לְאֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל, דַּיֵינוּ</p>

<h2>Second Cup</h2>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who redeemed us and our ancestors from Egypt, enabling us to reach this night and eat matzah and bitter herbs. May we continue to reach future holidays in peace and happiness.</p>
<p><strong>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.</em></p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruit of the vine.</p>
<p><em>Drink the second glass of wine!</em></p>

<h1>Rachtzah</h1>
<h2>Washing hands</h2>
<p>As we now transition from the formal telling of the Passover story to the celebratory meal, we once again wash our hands to prepare ourselves. In Judaism, a good meal together with friends and family is itself a sacred act, so we prepare for it just as we prepared for our holiday ritual, recalling the way ancient priests once prepared for service in the Temple.</p>
<p>After you have poured the water over your hands, recite this blessing.</p>
<p><strong>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָֽׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו, וְצִוָּנוּ  עַל נְטִילַת יָדָֽיִם</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu al n’tilat yadayim.</em></p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who made us holy through obligations, commanding us to wash our hands.</p>
<h1>Motzi-Matzah</h1>
<h2>Blessing over Matzah</h2>

<p>The familiar hamotzi blessing marks the formal start of the meal. Because we are using matzah instead of bread, we add a blessing celebrating this mitzvah.</p>
<p><strong>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, הַמּוֹצִיא לֶֽחֶם מִן הָאָֽרֶץ</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, hamotzi lechem min ha-aretz.</em></p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who brings bread from the land.</p>
<p><strong>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָֽׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתַָיו וְצִוָּֽנוּ עַל אֲכִילַת מַצָּה</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu al achilat matzah.</em></p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who made us holy through obligations, commanding us to eat matzah.</p>
<p>Distribute and eat the top and middle matzah for everyone to eat.</p>
<h1>Maror</h1>
<h2>Bitter herbs</h2>
<p>In creating a holiday about the joy of freedom, we turn the story of our bitter history into a sweet celebration. We recognize this by dipping our bitter herbs into the sweet charoset. We don’t totally eradicate the taste of the bitter with the taste of the sweet… but doesn’t the sweet mean more when it’s layered over the bitterness?</p>
<p><strong>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָֽׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו וְצִוָּֽנוּ עַל אֲכִילַת מרוֹר</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu al achilat maror.</em></p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who made us holy through obligations, commanding us to eat bitter herbs.</p>
<h2>Maror's symbolism</h2>
<p>The maror’s placement in our Seder may offer another perspective on its central role on the original Pesah. We eat the maror, along with the other symbolic foods, only after the end of Maggid—not only after the prolonged discussion of the misery of slavery, but also after reading the myriad midrashim of God’s miraculous redemption of the Israelites. By the time we finish telling the story and move into the eating section, we’re already free. The matzah we bless and eat right before the maror is not the matzah of lehem oni, the bread of affliction, which we recall at the beginning of the Maggid section. Rather, it is the matzah that symbolizes our freedom, the Israelites leaving Egypt in haste when the dough did not have time to rise. Only after we eat this matzah do we then eat the maror. If eating the maror were meant to remind us of the bitterness our ancestors experienced as slaves, then its placement in the Seder seems out of order. We should eat it much earlier than the matzah, when speaking about slavery in the early part of the Maggid section, not after crossing the sea, singing Dayyeinu and the psalms of Hallel. To make sense of its placement, we need a way to understand the maror that applies not only to our suffering in slavery, but also to our experience of freedom.</p>
<p>One way, then, that we can understand the Israelites eating the pesah lamb with merorim, and our own eating of the maror each year after tasting the matzah of liberation, is to recognize that maror is a fundamental part of life. Being human—not only being a slave—involves pain and suffering. When we take time to recognize and accept that reality, we can then learn to approach life with greater honesty, and a fuller set of tools to face the tougher moments.</p>
<h1>Koreich</h1>
<h2>Koreich</h2>
<p>Eating a sandwich of matzah and bitter herb | <em>koreich</em> | כּוֹרֵךְ</p>
<p>When the Temple stood in Jerusalem, the biggest ritual of them all was eating the lamb offered as the pesach or Passover sacrifice. The great sage Hillel would put the meat in a sandwich made of matzah, along with some of the bitter herbs. While we do not make sacrifices any more – and, in fact, some Jews have a custom of purposely avoiding lamb during the seder so that it is not mistaken as a sacrifice – we honor this custom by eating a sandwich of the remaining matzah and bitter herbs. Some people will also include charoset in the sandwich to remind us that God’s kindness helped relieve the bitterness of slavery.</p>
<h1>Shulchan Oreich</h1>
<h2>Eating the meal</h2>
<p>Enjoy the meal, but don’t forget when you’re done we’ve got a little more seder to go, including the final two cups of wine and dessert.</p>
<h1>Tzafun</h1>
<h2>Eating the Afikomen</h2>
<p>Now it is time for dessert. As we partake of the afikomen, it reminds us that we balance our solemn memories of slavery with a joyous celebration of freedom.</p>
<h1>Bareich</h1>
<h2>Birkat Hamazon</h2>
<p><em>[Fill everyone's cup]</p></em>
<p>We now say grace after the meal, thanking God for the food we’ve eaten. On Passover, this becomes something like an extended toast to God, culminating with drinking our third glass of wine for the evening:</p>

<h1>Hallel - Songs of praise</h1>

<h2>Min hameitzar - Psalm 118 5:6</h2>

<p><strong>מִן הַמֵּצַר קָרָאתִי יָּהּ, עָנָּנִי בַמֶרְחַב יָהּ. יי לִי לֹא אִירָא ,- מַה יַּעֲשֶׂה לִי אָדָם</strong></p>
<p><i>Min hameitzar karati yah, anani vamerchav yah. Adonai li lo ira, mah ya-aseh li adam.</i></p>
<p>From the narrow I called to the Lord, God answered me in the great freedom of space.</p>

<h2>Pitchu li - Psalm 118 19:20</h2>

<p><strong> פִּתְחוּ לִי שַׁעֲרֵי צֶדֶק, אָבֹא בָם, אוֹדֶה יָהּ. זֶה הַשַּׁעַר לַיי, צַדִּיקִים יָבֹאוּ בוֹ</strong></p>
<p><i>Pitchu li sha-arei tzedek, avo vam odeh yah. Zeh hasha-ar l’Adonai, tzadikim yavo-u vo.</i></p>
<p>Open the gates of righteousness, that I may enter and praise the Lord. This is the gateway to the Lord, the righteous shall enter through it.</p>


<h2>Hodu l'adonai - Psalm 118 28:29 & Psalm 136 1</h2>

<p><strong>אֵלִי אַתָּה וְאוֹדֶךָּ ,אֱלֹהַי אֲרוֹמְמֶךָּ</strong></p>
<p><strong>הוֹדוּ לַיי כִּי טוֹב, כִּי לְעוֹלָם חַסְדּוֹ</strong></p>
<p><i> Eili atah v'odeka, elohai arom'meka. </i></p>
<p><i>Hodu l'Adonai ki tov, ki l'olam chasdo. </i></p>
<p>You are my God, and I exalt you.</p>
<p>Give thanks to the Lord, for God is good; His kindness endures forever.</p>


<h2>Cup of Elijah</h2>
<p><em>[Fill everyone's cup]</p></em>
<p>We now refill our wine glasses one last time and open the front door to invite the prophet Elijah to join our seder.</p>
<p>In the Bible, Elijah was a fierce defender of God to a disbelieving people. At the end of his life, rather than dying, he was whisked away to heaven. Tradition holds that he will return in advance of messianic days to herald a new era of peace, so we set a place for Elijah at many joyous, hopeful Jewish occasions, such as a baby’s bris and the Passover seder.</p>
<p><strong>אֵלִיָּֽהוּ הַנָּבִיא, אֵלִיָּֽהוּ הַתִּשְׁבִּיאֵלִיָּֽהוּ, אֵלִיָּֽהוּ,אֵלִיָּֽהוּ הַגִּלְעָדִי</strong></p>

<p><strong>עִם מָשִֽׁיחַ בֶּן דָּוִד</strong></p>
<p><strong>עִם מָשִֽׁיחַ בֶּן דָּוִד</strong></p>

Eliyahu hatishbi<br />
Eliyahu, Eliyahu, Eliyahu hagiladi<br />
Bimheirah b’yameinu, yavo eileinu<br />
Im mashiach ben-David,<br />
Im mashiach ben-David</p>
<p>Elijah the prophet, the returning, the man of Gilad:<br />
return to us speedily,<br />
in our days with the messiah,<br />
son of David.</p>

<h2>Fourth Glass of Wine</h2>
<p><em>[Fill everyone's cup]</p></em>
<p>As we come to the end of the seder, we drink one more glass of wine. With this final cup, we give thanks for the experience of celebrating Passover together, for the traditions that help inform our daily lives and guide our actions and aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן</strong></p>
<p><em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.</em></p>
<p>We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruit of the vine.</p>

<h1>Nirtzah</h1>
<h2>World to come</h2>
<p><em>Nirtzah</em>  marks the conclusion of the seder. Our bellies are full, we have had several glasses of wine, we have told stories and sung songs, and now it is time for the evening to come to a close. Looking forward, let's sing a song looking forward to the next year and beyond.</p>
