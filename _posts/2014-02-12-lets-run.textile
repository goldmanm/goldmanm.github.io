As much as I love doing anything UX-related, on the weekends I just want to tear myself away and go enjoy the outside. 

Every Saturday, I run with a running club called the "Chattahoochee Road Runners":http://www.crrclub.com. They way CRR works is that we all convene at the same location in the morning, and we can choose what distances to run. The distances range anything from 7 miles up to 20 or more miles, and include evenly spaced water stops that the club sets out in the morning. 

The maps for the distances come on printed sheets of paper, and tell us on which streets to turn, where the next water stop is at, and how far we've run at each turn. Often, the sheets are hard to manage: you fumble with the page while running, and the text can be really small, and the paper can get soggy, and so on.

Let's Run! is the mobile equivalent of the paper map. It shows the same information like mileage, turn, street, and water stops, without the hassle of printing out and fumbling with a piece of paper. It also lets runners keep track of which turns they've hit by tapping on the turn they just finished.
