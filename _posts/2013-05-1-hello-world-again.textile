Hello World! This is probably my fifth time attempt at starting a blog, and my umpteenth personal portfolio design. And the first time I've married those two together. 

I'll admit, I'm not the most periodic type of writer. Most of my blogs have kind of... evaporated, for lack of better word. Usually, I run out of things to talk about, but, I figured I need to really start a new one- a professional one.

As an active practitioner in User Experience and design, and active hobbyist, I kind of realized I need a tiny corner of the web to sound off my ideas, tips, and opinions on things, hopefully get my thoughts out and give someone a lending hand along the way.

The UX and web design community is vibrant and full of smart people, many of whom share knowledge on their own blogs. Despite not being a particularly prolific writer, I feel like we're obliged as professionals to voice our own opinions, share our techniques, and to give a little feedback back to the community.

This blog will mostly focus on User Experience, Interaction and Experiential Design and Game Design topics.

Stuff is soon to follow. Keep posted!
