This portfolio site has been around for about a year now. Over the last year I've expanded on the code that this site was built on into a much more powerful responsive framework. So I thought, a year later, it's time for refresh. Not a complete redesign of the entire site, just refreshing the back-end code, and tweaking everything to be a little more neater, and tighter. Make it "pop."

To start, I hit up "mediaqueri.es":http://mediaqueri.es for inspiration.

And what I noticed was... almost all responsive sites are blocky and kind of look the same They're all mostly rectangular columns. Some images and copy are plopped here and there. Some smaller rectangles stacked on top of each other.
Even some of the fun sites I found, like "Packdog":http://packdog.com were very gridded:

h2. Give a man a hammer and everything looks like a nail

There's a reason why everything looks so blocky: it's in the tools we use. Responsive web design has taken over the web in the last few years, and it's great. RWD makes websites read and work well on all devices. It makes sites clean, and establishes a great framework for layout out content that would otherwise be difficult to layout.

But its strength&mdash;the grid&mdash; is also its weakness. Take a look at this "example from Brad Frost":http://codepen.io/bradfrost/full/cgHtv:

The layout grid is extremely powerful, as it allows pieces of content to shift around in a way that fills the space on the page perfectly. However, if used carelessly, the final output might end up looking like the stacks of boxes on this page.



h2. Design is difficult. Clean design, even more

I realize I'm complaining a little bit. Websites have come light-years away from their interactive CD-ROM-influenced "brethren from the 90's":http://zachholman.com/posts/only-90s-developers/. We've moved away from glaring use of "colors, animations, and effects":http://www2.warnerbros.com/spacejam/movie/jam.htm. And with the inception (and eventualy passing) of "Flat UI," we're collectively aiming towards designing for context and behavior. Some designs will be flat and uncomplicated. Others will be warm and ooze character.

And just as with Flat UI, we'll soon grow tired of our vanilla use of the grid. We'll want to free ourselves from it; think outside of its borders, and break it.



h2. Break the Grid

The "Museum of Design Atlanta":http://www.museumofdesign.org/ recently held a Paul Rand exhibit. A thought kept coming back to me&mdash;every layout was based on a grid, and every pattern expertly broke it.

Smashing Magazine has a "hugely inspirational article":http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/17/lessons-from-swiss-style-graphic-design/ on employing Swiss design, and how to employ spacing, whitespace, colors, and so on to make a layout stand out.

A way to push the boundaries of the grid would be to employ a much larger grid, like a 32 column grid (most only go up to 12 or 16 right now), or the new Flexbox spec, which will allow content to be placed in many different new ways, without designers needing to resort to tricky hacks and workarounds.

Websites are already starting to develop their own character, though many are still following certain trends. I think we'll have another web design 'revolution' in only a year or so, where many designers will start taking our current concepts and make their sites uniquely their own.



h2. Freeing Ourselves

So I'm pretty much guilty of all the above things.

Therefore, I resolve that for 2014, is to push this site outside of those boundaries, even just a little bit. I'll move this site to a super grid of 32 columns, and add a splash of color here and there. I'll even document the process this time.

So here's to 2014, to freeing ourselves from the grid, a baby step at a time.
