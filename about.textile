h1(h1-display). Hello,

h4(about-quote). stay a while, and listen
</div>

p(dropcap). My name is Jan (yawn!), and I design experiences. Some of them include _responsive websites_, _mobile apps_, and _data-heavy interfaces_. I also dabble in _experimental games_ and _installation art_. 

I apply a user-centered design approach to my projects, and I aim to strike a balance between satisfying user needs and business goals. My projects involve lots of iterative designing, prototyping, and testing, and I strive for my work to be immersive, elegant, and memorable. 

These times are exceptional. We've elevated technology from our desks, laps, palms, and wrists into into our minds. We're looking at how technology may lend us more time, freedom, peace of mind, and help us be healthier and more creative. 

These times are exceptional, and I'm ready to get my hands dirty.

h2. More About Me

I've always had a fascination with learning, doing, and experimenting, and my experience spans across research, design, and writing code.
I have experience with Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office, Axure, and other design and productivity tools. I prefer to prototype websites in HTML, JavaScript and SASS/CSS, and other experiences in Flash, but I'm familiar with anything from C to Processing.

My eclectic background mirrors my eclectic upbringing. Though born in China, I moved to Stockholm at a young age. I am fluent in English and Swedish, and conversational in Mandarin.

I hold dual citizenship with both the United States and Sweden, which means that I could easily work in and out of the U.S. and countries European Union without a work visa.

On my off days, I enjoy swing dancing, rock climbing, playing indie games, and cooking / stuffing my face with tasty foods.

h2. About This Site

For the second round of redesign, I wanted to reduce the number of artifacts on the page, like shapes and outlines, and take a more typographic, minimalist approach. Any shapes and lines are only used to accentuate the information I'm presenting, with enough white space to prevent clutter.

This site is now my umpteen+1th portfolio design, but every iteration has seen improvement. The site is built on the static site generator "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll and is hosted completely for free on "Github Pages":https://github.com/janzheng/janzheng.github.com.

The front-end styling was written in SASS, with the help of "bourbon.io" and "Neat":neat.bourbon.io, with a glass of "Belle Meade":http://www.greenbrierdistillery.com/nelsons_green_brier_products.html on the side.

Icons are sourced from "IconMonstr":http://iconmonstr.com/ and Zurb from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title="Flaticon">Flaticon.com</a>

Cheers, 
Jan
