h2. Writing is Hard.

p(post-first-sentence). That probably doesn't come as a surprise, considering my posts are dated a year apart from each other. Maybe writing is just hard for me. I tend to re-read my sentences, correct myself ad nauseam until my sentences seem right. Or I get distracted. And then I erase the entire paragraph because it doesn't fit. Most people call it Writer's Block: the scourge of a writer's productivity.

But I'm not so sure that it's a real medical affliction. It's more of a manifestation of doubts and anxieties in theirwork or abilities. It might be the sheer size of the challenge of writing itself that stops would-be writers in their tracks. Or our ability to constantly question our decisions. Or our technology-fueled ability to self-criticize and compare ourselves to the "successes of others":http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/the-real-reason-facebook-makes-us-unhappy.html.


h2. But Writing can be Wonderful.

p. Creative writing on its own, without any distractions or goals or objectives or spellchecking, can also be a beautiful thing. As a kid I used to write many short stories, if anything, as a way to let my mind loose. When you write creatively, you give yourself this sandbox of unlimited possibilities. You can completely let go; let inner child and sense of wonderment come alive. It doesn't have to make sense. In fact, no one should read it. When you write for yourself, it shouldn't make sense. These are your inner thoughts and your soul at work; your ego and your super-ego wrestling control, and letting loose on the keyboard. 

A pure, free-flowing writing state is a combination meditation and play; an exhilarating stream of subconsciousness, spilling dreams on paper. 

Unfortunately, most of us are conditioned to not let our subconscious wander too far. Our pursuits of perfection distract us from retreating into a meditative state. Accordingly,writing subconsciously is suggested to make us both "faster and more creative writers":http://www.creativitypost.com/create/writing_at_the_speed_of_the_unconscious.

h2. Novel Under Deadlines

National Writing Novel Month, or "NaNoWriMo":http://NaNoWriMo.com, is a program about using time as a constraint for creativity. On the November 1, roughly 340,000 people begin their novels from scratch. On Nov. 30, they must reach 50,000 words, or roughly 1,500 words a day to win. It's an easy goal for professional writers, but hard for us with only a fleeting curiosity in writing. Distractions like work, friends, and errands get in the way. Out of the 340,000 participants, only 40,000 finished. 

The point of NaNo is for beginners to stop over-thinking, and start writing. To eschew quality for quantity: to achieve the goal of writing a long piece of narrative. Nano encourages potential writers to put words on paper, and to not worry about quality. They encourage writers to finish their first drafts, and to fight through their Writers' block.


h2. Feature Reduction

!/assets/posts/nanowrito/1.png!
Technology has enabled us to do more. In writing, movable type and typewriters have made us more prolific. Computers and text-editors have introduced the freedom of editing: to change, reflow, and to move anything around.

All these technologies have enabled us to do more, but in that pursuit of more, we've lost a sense of purity. Similar to decision paralysis, more option suddenly blocks our ability for action. 

The recent trend for minimalism and reduction reflect this notion, like "Flat UI":http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/03/flat-and-thin-are-in/ and Durr, "the face-less watch":http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/30/5361210/skrekkogle-durr-the-watch-without-a-face. 

Minimalism can also give us a distraction-free writing experience, as we strip down the word processor to its basic core, to only keep the bare necessities. In the case of NaNoWriMo, we optimize for writing speed. The best example I could find was that of a typewriter (pictured: my Sears Tower typewriter). 



h2. Zen Mode

"!/assets/posts/nanowrito/2.png!":http://nanowrito.org

I created NanoWrito during the first week of November 2013, after trying to find a better alternative than Word or Sublime. I needed something simple, not distracting, and could tell me the word count easily. Something more similar to a typewriter than a word processor. So I set out to create my own app. 

It's very minimalist, as it consists of a text-box and a word counter, that large 0 looking into your eyes. When users click enter, the text is moved to an uneditable field where users won't be able to go back and fix anything. Anything they write is immutable durig this session. An alternate Zen Mode darkens the screen and blurs out the previously written words, so users can't clearly read the content, but would know that their work is being updated. A Flash module assists in copying the work to somewhere safe, and the Close functionality is guarded from accidentally closing the app. 

For the month of November, the project was fairly successful. I only put up links on the NanoWrimo apps forum, and on the NaNoWriMo subreddit, and garnered a few thousand unique visitors, with a number of daily recurring visitors.

And where in the previous two years I barely finished using the entire month of November, this year I was also able to finish my novel in less than two weeks.
