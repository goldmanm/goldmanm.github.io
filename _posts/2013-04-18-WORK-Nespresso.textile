p. "Nespresso":http://www.nespresso-us.com/boutique/ is an espresso coffee machine company who came to us looking to give their exclusive network of coffee shops a stronger online presence. They wanted a place for their fans to learn more about their Boutiques, and needed a site to match the style, elegance, and exclusivity of their local Boutiques.
