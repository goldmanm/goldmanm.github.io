<h1>THE TEN MINUTE SEDER</h1>

<h2>LEADER</h2>
Welcome to our interactive Seder! We are going to go through the essence of the Seder: Kiddush, The Four Questions, We Were Slaves, Four Children, Plagues, Dayeinu, Pesach, Matzah, Maror and Hallel—all in around 10 minutes. Hold on to your Matzahs! Now we are going to bless the holiday of Passover together:
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SAY TOGETHER</h2>
Blessed is the maker of the fruit of the vine! <br><br>Baruch ata adonai eloheinu melech haolam, borei pri hagafen. <br><br>Thank you for God for giving us festivals and seasons to rejoice, and this Festival of Matzot to commemorate the Exodus from Egypt. You have made us and our seasons of joy holy! 
<br>
<br>[ ∆ Drink first cup of grape juice / wine ]
<h2>LEADER</h2>
Let us recite the Shehechiyanu Prayer thanking God that we have come together for this Seder:
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SAY TOGETHER</h2>
Thank you God for bringing us to this time and place! Baruch Ata Adonay Elohenu Melech Ha-olam, She-hechiyanu, V’kimanu, V’heegianu, La’zman hazeh.

[ ∆ Holding matzah high ] <br><br>This is the poor man’s bread that our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt. All who are hungry, come and eat, all who are in distress, come share Passover with us! This year we are here, next year let’s celebrate in Jerusalem. This year we are slaves, next year may we be free! Now, I have four questions:
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SING TOGETHER THE FOUR QUESTIONS</h2>
Ma nishtanah halailah hazeh mikol haleilot?<br>
Sheb'khol haleilot anu okhlin hametz umatzah; halailah hazeh [x2], kuloh matzah. [x2]<br>
Sheb'khol haleilot anu okhlin sh'ar y'rakot; halailah hazeh [x2], kulo maror. [x2]<br>
Sheb'khol haleilot ein anu matbilin afilu pa'am ehat; halailah hazeh [x2] , shtei f'amim. [x2]<br>
Sheb'khol haleilot anu okhlin bein yoshvin uvein m'subin; halailah hazeh [x2], kulanu m'subin. [x2]
<h2>PARTICIPANT</h2>
1. What's up with the matzoh? <br>2. What's the deal with horseradish? <br>3. What's with the dipping of the herbs? <br>4. What's this whole chilling at the table business?
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SAY TOGETHER</h2>
We were slaves in Egypt. God lifted us out with awesome miracles. Had God not taken us out of Egypt, then what? We, and our children, and our children’s children would still be slaves in Egypt! Therefore, even if we were all wise people of understanding, all elders well-versed in the Torah, we would still be commanded to tell about the Exodus from Egypt. All people who discuss the story of Passover at length are praiseworthy
<h2>LEADER</h2>
The Torah reflects upon four types of kids: One Wise, One Evil, One Simple, and One Who Doesn’t Know How To Ask. <br>GUIDE the wise one through the obligations of Passover. <br>TELL the Evil One, we need you to be part of our people. <br>EXPLAIN to the Simple One, “with a strong hand God brought us out of Egypt.” <br>ENGAGE the one who doesn’t know how to ask, make that child feel comfortable, and tell them about the Exodus.
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SAY TOGETHER</h2>
[ ∆ Take a drop of juice/wine from your cup for each plague] <br><br>There are ten plagues which God brought upon the Egyptians: 
<br><br>
Blood — frogs — Lice — Wild Beasts — Disease — Boils — Hail and fire — Locusts — Darkness — Death of the first born.

<h2>LEADER LEADS SINGING OF DAYEINU</h2>
Dei, Deiyenu x 4

<h2>PARTICIPANTS SING TO TUNE OF DAYEINU</h2>
If God had taken us out of Egypt and not punished our enemies, it would've been enough. If God punished our enemies and not parted the Red Sea, it would've been enough. If God brought us the Torah, but not brought us to Israel, it would have been enough! If God brought us to Israel, but didn’t build a Temple, it would have been enough.
<h2>LEADER</h2>
Rabbi Gamliel would say: Whoever does not discuss three things on Passover has not fulfilled their obligations: Pesach, Matzah and Maror.
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SAY TOGETHER</h2>
[ ∆ point to the shankbone ] <br><br>PESACH is the sacrifice our ancestors would eat during the time of the Temple, because God passed over the houses of our ancestors in Egypt.
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SAY TOGETHER</h2>
[ ∆ point to matzah ] <br><br>This is MATZAH. Because the dough of our ancestors did not have time to rise before God redeemed them from Egypt.
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SAY TOGETHER</h2>
[ ∆ point to Maror ] <br><br>This is MAROR - why do we eat it? Because the Egyptians oppressed our ancestors in Egypt, they made their lives bitter with hard labor, with mortar and bricks, and other hardships.
<h2>LEADER</h2>
Friends, in every generation we need to feel like WE had left Egypt. So now we need to thank and praise God for the miracles of the Exodus. Halleluyah! Thank you God for everything!
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SAY TOGETHER</h2>
Blessed is the maker of the fruit of the vine! <br><br>[ ∆ Hebrew version above — Drink the Second Cup]
<h2>LEADER</h2>
Blessed is the maker of bread. Blessed is God who commanded us to eat Matzah! <br><br>Baruch ata adonai eloheinu melech ha olam, ha motzi lechem min haaretz, <br><br>Baruch ata adonai eloheinu melech haolam asher kidshanu b mitzvotav v tzivanu al achilat matzah.<br><br>
[ ∆ everyone eat matzah ]<br><br>
Blessed is God who commanded us to eat Maror! <br><br>Baruch ata adonai ha motzi lechem min haaretz, Baruch ata adonai eloheinu melech haolam asher kidshanu b mitzvotav v tzivanu al achilat maror<br><br>
[ ∆ Everyone eat the Maror- Horseradish or Romain lettuce ]<br><br>
Rabbi Hillel would combine the Passover offering, the Matzah and Maror together in a sandwich and eat them to fulfil the words of the Torah “They shall eat it with Matzah and bitter herbs.”<br><br>
[ ∆ Make a sandwich from matzah, Charoset and Horseradish ]
[ ∆ EAT the Passover meal ]
<h2>PARTICIPANTS SAY TOGETHER</h2>
Thank you God for this awesome meal! Blessed is the maker of the fruit of the vine!<br><br>
[ ∆ Hebrew version above — Drink the Third Cup ]<br><br>
[ ∆ Sing together] <br>“Oseh Shalom bimromav, who ya’aseh shalom aleinu, v al kol yisrael, v’imru, amen! Yaaseh shalom, yaaseh shalom, shalom aleinu, v al kol yisrael. <br><br>[ ∆ Say together ] <br>God bring peace to the Jewish People!<br><br>
Blessed is the maker of the fruit of the vine! [ ∆ Hebrew version above — Drink the Fourth Cup ]
