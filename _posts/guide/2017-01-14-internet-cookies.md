Cookies are delicious and dangerous. Given a box in front of me, I could eat them until my stomach and girth explodes, with the sugar high and its corresponding crash. I have vowed not to buy or make cookies to keep them out of arm's reach, but they still come into my life from friends and conferences. Internet Cookies, whose name was obtained from the already appropriated fortune cookie (cites an unreferenced [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Origin_of_the_name), can be just as delicious and dangerous. Internet cookies can be used to obtain data about your browsing and without them many websites won't function. For example, a website you viewed a month ago can store a cookie on your browser and know when and were you went online ever since. I had tried solutions to reject all cookies from websites. After months of manually enabling every single script for each website, I ended up giving into the convenience of cookies. Like the allure of sugar-filled cookies during an academic seminar, I found I wasn't a very good at tee-totaling from internet cookies. 

A few months ago, someone added my MIT email as a Google contact and then Youtube recommended them to watch [this video of me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_ruszXDCZA), which I never posted. Furthermore, I didn't even have a Google account with that email, so the connection Google made must have been quite sophisticated. I don't have a problem with that video, but I don't want everyone who knows my email to be 'suggested' anything about me without my consent. I felt that my ability to project myself to others had been uprooted by technology.

Recently, a knowledgeable undergrad showed me [self-destructing cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/self-destructing-cookies/), a browser add-on that destroys cookies the moment you leave a website. In it I found a compromise to let websites be usable again and avoid the notorious side effects of tracking cookies in my life. Whenever I closed my amazon or facebook tag, the cookies associated with those sites would go away, which meant that I would constantly need to log back on. This compromise was worth it for me, similar to my avoidance of making or buying food-cookies. Though like my aunt's cookies in my living room which I feel bad consuming or throwing out, MIT gave me the gift of [two factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication), which relies partially on internet cookies to function. I needed these cookies on my computer to effectively find journal articles, download tax forms, and utilize course resources. I added a little exception to my cookie destroyer for `idp.mit.edu` (remembers to use certificates when logging in) and `duosecurity.com` (remembers my authentication for 30 days). This allows me to access MIT resources and still block information from other data hounds. I just hope these 'allowed' cookies are whole grain with a low glycemic index. 

Note that preventing tracking cookies is just one way to reduce how websites collect data on you. Many resources exist on other ways, so why don't you [search for it](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+improve+internet+privacy&t=canonical)?
