When arriving at our amazing campus, your email box will start to quickly swell. You may signup for organizational emails, and others will secretly add you to their lists as well. This led me to look into ways of sorting through all the mess. I found that most students ship their MIT email over to Google for sorting. My super-techy friends even kept a script on their private server for parsing messages. I was happy using Thunderbird for my email client, so I looked for other solutions. The one described below will work for Outlook, Thunderbird, your phone, and the web-users. 

# how to get automatic sorting of emails.

First, head over to the web-interface `owa.mit.edu` and log into your account. You can create filters by going to 'Options'-> 'Create an Inbox Rule...'.

Here you can create a list of different sorting rules. Each rule requires a trigger and an action. The triggers I've used are the words used in the email ('BC-talk'), the sender's address ('ispamyou@spam.sucks'), who the email is sent to ('a-fun-club@mit.edu'), or words in the title ('Automatic Reply:'). The responding action is normally how you'd like to sort your email. The rules apply top-to-bottom, and the first trigger sends it to that folder.

You might want to take a second to think about how to best sort your email. My method is described at the end if you need any inspiration.

I feel once you get to the Inbox Rule page, it can be pretty intuitive.  Just one **warning**, some email apps, like your phone's mail or Thunderbird, might not automatically sync the folders, so you may need to go to settings and enable those folders to sync. 

# an example of sorting design

Email sorting will probably be an iterative process. Here is my current iteration. Each email is proccessed going from top-to-bottom, so that I get important emails while blocking others.

trigger							| action			| purpose
--------------------------------|-------------------|---------
Title has 'run complete'		| move to `code`	| inform me when computational jobs finished
sent from robot email-addresses	| move to `junk`	| get rid of promotional stuff who puts my name in heading
sent to my email address		| move to `important`| prioritize personal emails
sent to dorm lists				| move to `dorm`	| sort out for after work
sent to department lists		| move to `department`| for skimming when bored
sent to student group lists		| move to `clubs`	| to browse when on break
subject contains '[GSC-anno]'	| move to `clubs`	| special class because the email is BCC'ed
sent to research group lists	| move to `research`| to peruse while at work
from github						| move to `code`	| to look at in office
sent from student-spammers		| move to `junk`	| this is a manually updated list of people who blind copy the whole campus without saying they are blind-copying people. updated about every semester.
email contains 'BCC'ed' or 'BC-talk'| move to `junk`| this automatically removes the polite emails that mention they blind copyied people

Feel free to send me advice if you think I could improve this system or just let me know if this helps.
