This past semester, I took an MIT Sloan class called [Entrepreneurial Strategy](). Through each lecture, this course drove deeper into fundamental business decesions of a start-up. Being my first business course, unknown more-general business concepts flew around the class. I found two of these concepts mysteriously complex and also fundamental: value creation and value capture. In the class context, value creation is the benefit to people created by the business. Value capture is how a venture collects value from the environment in order to sustain and grow. For example, Facebook provides values to users by connecting them and to advertisers by allowing access to the users. Facebook captures value by charging the advertisers for access to the users. Essential to this course is alligning the value creation and value capture with other parts of your business to make a sucessful market entry.

### when revinue undermines a business creating value

The drive to make profit often leads companies to enhance their value capture, which often comes at the expense of creating value for consumers. This becomes detrimental when value creation becomes at odds with value capture, usually by finding some unexpected loophole. I'll explain an extreme example in history and then talk about a more subtle issue. 

A hallmark of colonialism is that the dominant power provides culture and investment to subjegated people and is also able to extract revinue from the territory. In my mind, these two items seem to misalign more than they align, which is one reason why colonialism was detrimental to most of the world's population. I recently just finished a book that dove into issues of the British East India Company (BEIC) in what is now Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. During the early 20th centruy, the main revinue from the colonies was from the BEIC selling opium to the countries inhabitants. The British actually would initially discount opium to encourage the addictive habit. The encouragement of drug use for revenue directly contridicts the value creation goal of providing culture and investment to the area. Other examples of BEIC's colonial practices involved eliminating the local trading class by imposing a monopoly, not inforcing human trafficing laws, and using unjustified stereotypes to justify improper treatment. Colonialism is on the extreme of value capture being antagonistic to value creation, but many cases today are not so obvious. 

The formation of ponzi schemes are an example of misalligned insentives causing eliminating value creation. This is a brief descrtion, and a more full analysis is on [](). An investment company provides value by getting the investors high returns, often higher than the indexes, and they make profit based on the a fee for the investment. The more more money in a firm, the more they can make, but they need to post good returns to entice more investment. One way to motivate people to invest in the firm might be to fudge numbers, essentially lying about their value creation so they can capture more value. These lies might propagate into a full blown ponzi scheme, which actually destroys value for all the investors. Though the value creation and value capture in investing are not as antagonistic as the BEIC, faking numbers is a loophole which has been used multiple times to take advantage of the gap between value creation and value capture.

Like the investing world or the British East India Company, the value capture in academia is sometimes adverse to value creation. To many academics, value creation is increasing the world's knowledge on a topic. Value capture is often obtained by prestegious achievements, like a Nobel, big research grant, or getting published in a prestigious journal or write a manuscript. There are numerous BEIC-like examples where people publish fake results. To mitigate this extreme ethical breach, academic culture often shuns those caught faking results. 

### academics face the same issues

Personally, I've found subtler discrepencies between value creation and value capture more inhibiting in my field of computational chemical informatics. Many papers exist for new methods of analyzing complex chemical systems which never mention or share the code used for the analysis. [......] authors may see some benefit by hiding code to requiring others to rewrite the method, so they can publish more papers and stay ahead of other groups, though I do not think this is the reason for most papers. 

Many researchers just have terribly messy code, which the authors struggle to use after the paper is published. I recently looked into someone's code for a method I was interested in. The author said there was a 'high learning curve'. The documentation was a 138 page file of method headers, which meant the code wasn't commented, and it seemed extremely messy. For another paper, my group member emailed the author of the paper and code, who recommened that he would probably rewrite the code entirely if he had to work on the project again. His goal was to publish papers and could deal with the messy code while it was fresh in his mind. In a meta-analysis, Prof. West found that only [---] percent of papers in the 2013 combustion institute had supplimental code to help others reproduce the work. 

Allowing number of citations encourages sharing code.

Making code usable by others does take time, but it can also save themselves time by allowing effective reuse of code. [cite study showing benefits of writing good code](). Since motivation is primarily about perception, it seems like the percieved effort of creating good code inhibits others from doing the beneficial work. Getting computational researchers to create readable and sharable code could improve the pace of research, and more options than ever exist for this to happen. I currently use [GitHub](http://www.github.com) to store and share my scripts. [list other resources from talks] 

Getting others to value producing reusable code might benefit from shifting the value capture element. Many approaches could incourage this. People could value citations more, as reusable ideas are likely to get more cited. Journals could require open code for publications, which could improve their impact factor. Some Journals have already made requirements of utilizing online resources to validate methodology in psycology, so it doesn't seem impossible. If you think of other ideas to encourage the writing of good code and sharing it, [email me](markgoldman@mit.edu).

It doesn't seem like academia is immune to gaps in value creation and capture. We have mitigated the extreme examples, so maybe we could focus on impactful nuanced examples.
