h1. III. Page Architecture

h3. Architecture & Sitemap

The site is small and has few categories, and no control states or paths. The narrative content would make sense if told as a single, linear story, and thus would best be served on one page. Multiple pages for small amounts of content will lead to more friction and click fatigue. Multiple pages with more interesting content or interactions could be more engaging, but would not be appropriate given the smaller scope of the project. In the end, a simple, single narrative page would be both more effective and more efficient. 

The marketing page will use loosely borrow from the Marketing copy. For wireframe and design exercise purposes, I'll create a single design that I think will strike a good balance between the two mentioned approaches. Otherwise, if given time and scope, I would explore more ways to express the narrative.

The copy is for placement only, and each section details what the section is meant to accomplish. Because content and narrative is so important, I will try to stay away from lorem ipsum placeholders and use FPO copy that try to convey the content.

h4. 1. What is Google News?

Google News is a personalized news service that collects headlines from around the world, and helps you stay up to speed on stories based on both your location and your interests.

h4. 2. How does it work?

Traditionally, news readers first pick a publication and then look for headlines that interest them. On Google News, we first show trending stories and headlines, then let you choose the publication to read.

Inset Text:
Our articles are selected and ranked by computers that evaluate, among other things, how often and on what sites a story appears online. We also rank based on certain characteristics of news content such as freshness, location, relevance and diversity. As a result, stories are sorted without regard to political viewpoint or ideology and you can choose from a wide variety of perspectives on any given story.
