Well, I'll be honest. I'm a terrible writer, and I'm terrible at updating content. Most of the time I feel like I don't have anything to talk about.

But, as an active practitioner in User Experience and web design, and an active maker of cool and experimental stuff, I kind of realized I need a tiny corner of the web to show off things to say, and share a little back with the community.

Thing is, the community is vibrant and full of smart people, many of whom share knowledge for free. Despite my not enjoying writing, as a professional, I need to have a public voice for my opinions tips, and give-back to the community.

This site will look at User Experience, Game Deisng, and Interaction Design topics. And probably a few more other ones. 

In this side of the web, I'll be focusing on User Experience & Interaction Design, Web Design, and Game Design. 

Good stuff is coming. Promise!
