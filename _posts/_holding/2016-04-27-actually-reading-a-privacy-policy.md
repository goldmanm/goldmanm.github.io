[Mint](https://www.mint.com/) is a service that gives people all their finances in one page, and has brought me some convenience. Through the ~3 years of using their service I saw the increasing of advertisements and stagnation of new features. Some of its advertisements are terribly inaccurate. For example, I got a fee refund in my transactions section, and mint posted an add "you just got a fee. you should apply for a fee-free [checking account](https://www.ted.com/watch/ted-institute/ted-ibm/marie-wallace-privacy-by-design)". Ironically, I already input into Mint that I already had the exact account they were advertising, and I got the refund from that account. These type of adds have happened quite often, and I am not sure if they are incompetent or get more revenue for putting irrelevant ads.

Yesterday, they updated their terms of service and privacy policy so I took a look at it. I'll leave you with what I found the most striking (section 13: rules for posting):

	"By submitting content to us, you represent that you have all necessary rights and hereby grant us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, modify, display, and perform all or any portion of the content in connection with Services and our business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the site (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels."
	
This overarching rights I am granting to the company, hidden within the 15,000 words of legalese, really did not make me feel comfortable giving Intuit my data. Thankfully, I found that I could delete my account and Intuit will remove some of my data within 48 hours. They claim all the data will be removed, though their statement "some information may be retained on a server or media, which is necessary to help ensure continued availability of our products and services" raises some concerns for me. For example, would keeping the data to sell to others (so they can stay in business) be considered necessary to ensure the availability of products? Honestly, I am not sure how far this statement can be taken am not going to call a lawyer to find out. 

While I appreciate the convenience Mint has provided me, I don't feel they really have my best interests at heart. I'll happily go back to managing my own finances manually (which I've already started due to many numerical errors in Mint's algorithms)
