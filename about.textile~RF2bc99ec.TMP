h1(center h1-display). Well hello there,


h4(center about-quote). stay a while, and listen

p(dropcap). These are exciting times: the era of technology as we know it is coming to an end. Machines are no longer confined to desks, laps, or even palms. We have reached a point where mainstream culture is comfortable enough to coexist with technology, where using machines is no longer considered "nerdy," and where everyone - from infants to grandmothers - are increasingly comfortable with trusting technology. 

We are entering an era where designers, developers, and technologists can start to look at how technology can give us more time, more freedom, and peace of mind, and ways to inspire health, creativity, and personal expression.

These are exciting times, and I'm ready to get my hands dirty.



h2. About Jan

My name is Jan ('yawn'), and I am an design digital experiences. 

I strive for my work to be immersive, memorable, and delightful. Some of these experiences include _responsive websites_, _mobile_, and _data-heavy interfaces_, and experimental games.

For each of my projects, I apply plenty of care, along with user-centered design, research, and lots of iterative design, prototyping, and testing.

bq(blockquote-wide no-quotes). I currently live in *(strong-loud)Atlanta*, and work as a full-time *(strong-loud)Sr. User Experience Architect* with "Nurun":http://www.nurun.com.

I am currently *(strong-loud)not available* for freelance work, but go ahead and say hello anyway: "hello@janzheng.com":mailto:hello@janzheng.com, "twitter":https://twitter.com/janistanian, or "linkedin":http://www.linkedin.com/in/janzh.





h2. About This Site

For the second round of redesign, I wanted to reduce the number of artifacts on the page, like lines, curves, outlines, and blocks, and take a more typographic, minimalist approach. Any shapes and lines are only used to accentuate the information I'm presenting, with enough white space to prevent clutter.

This site is now my umpteen+1th portfolio design, but every iteration has seen improvement. The site is built on the static site generator "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll and is hosted completely for free on "Github Pages":https://github.com/janzheng/janzheng.github.com.

The front-end styling was written in SASS, with the help of "bourbon.io" and "Neat":neat.bourbon.io, with a glass of "Belle Meade":http://www.greenbrierdistillery.com/nelsons_green_brier_products.html on the side.

Icons are sourced from "IconMonstr":http://iconmonstr.com/ and Zurb from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title="Flaticon">Flaticon.com</a>

Cheers, 
Jan
