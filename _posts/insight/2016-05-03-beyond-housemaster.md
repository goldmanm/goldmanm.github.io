In light of the Yale University [controversy](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/nyregion/yale-culturally-insensitive-halloween-costumes-free-speech.html?_r=0) regarding a housemaster’s statement, many universities, including Harvard and MIT, have discussed changing the title of housemaster to something that has less racial & colonial baggage. Recently, MIT stated that they would change the title to ‘Head of House’, a reference to Harry Potter. I personally think only good can come from the name change, and that MIT is acknowledging issues with this statement.

I want to raise another question, that in my opinion is thornier and also more important: Should MIT try to dissuade usage of sexist/colonialist terms in the courses? If so, how should they go about this? In many fields that were dominated by white males, hetero-normative and racist terms became wide spread as technical, colloquial jargon. For example, in electrical plugs, it is common to hear the ‘male’ side and the ‘female’ side. Or in my process control at MIT, an outer control loop was called a ‘master controller’ and the inside loop was called a ‘slave controller’. I have also experienced similar lingo used for processors in super-computing. For me personally, these terms have shocked me more than ‘housemaster’ (though other students may have different experiences).

I feel that since most of these terms arose from engineering, MIT students are likely exposed to these terms more frequently than at Harvard or Yale. If there is a school that could influence technical lingo, MIT would likely be it. As our president claims, [MIT can and should influence the world](http://president.mit.edu/speeches-writing/launch-event-mit-campaign-better-world). Not allowing these micro-aggressions in the classroom might help [encourage underrepresented groups in STEM](https://depts.washington.edu/anthweb/resources/diverse_pdfs/diversity_microagressions_11.pdf).

Would removing the lingo that industry currently uses make our us unprepared for life post-graduation? I think that MIT students would be able to pick up a few more jargon when they enter the workforce. I am not as convinced that shielding us from discriminatory practices helps us deal emotionally when we leave shielding academia. That may have been the view of the [housemaster’s letter](https://www.thefire.org/email-from-erika-christakis-dressing-yourselves-email-to-silliman-college-yale-students-on-halloween-costumes/) at Yale.  During a corporate internship, I was shocked that the company didn’t offer same-sex partner benefits, which led me to reject an official job offer from them. Had my university not had a Rainbow Lounge, I might be less shocked by reality outside of school and possibly ore inclined to be working for that company. By removing the current jargon, we could be increasing the gap between academic and corporate culture (which is another potential issue in itself). On the other hand, given time this policy might actually change corporate culture and the terminology used throughout the world.

MIT has a spectrum of opportunities that can effect potential emotionally triggering technical terms. Here are a few possibilities:

1.       Keep the status quo (professors have final authority at choosing terms).
2.       MIT suggests professors use alternative terms in the [MIT Community and Equity Officer Report](http://iceoreport.mit.edu/)
3.       Professors are required to mention and give students alternative terms, but can still use traditional terms
4.       Banning potentially offensive terms in classrooms

Implementing any decision may start with recommendations in the next MIT inclusiveness report. Changing classroom terminology definitely has more difficult logistics than creating the ‘head of house’ title, but I feel that it has potential for an impact farther than our land-filled section of Cambridge. Finding the balance between professor autonomy, student autonomy, student comfort, and the transition into companies will be key in these decisions.
